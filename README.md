# Mod 2, Stock Analysis

## Overview
Using VBA in Excel, the exercise is to run through a stock spreadsheet to pull basic data out and produce a simple output table. The basis of the module is to teach VBA while showing how to simplify the code in order to speed up the processing time.


## Analysis
The stocks analyzed in 2017 performed moderately well to extremely well. As shown in the below image.


However in 2018, those same stocks pretty much sucked except for two.



The time to run the macros doing the analysis shortened, as expected.


## Summary
Advantages to refactoring is reducing the potential of introducing errors by repeating code.  Basically reducing typing errors. This also streamlines the code to run faster. A disadvantage, at least for a beginning coder, is not fully understanding what the refactored code is doing, primarily because of unclear comments explaining the code.

I found that with how my fingers flub along the keyboard at times, the less I have to imput the better.  That means I am not using the backspace as much to correct errors. My only question with the code I used is why I have (12) in step 1b.
